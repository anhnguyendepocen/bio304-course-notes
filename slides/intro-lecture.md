## Modern biological data is...

* Heterogeneous (sequence data, species distributions, protein concentrations, etc)

* High-dimensional (genome-wide, GIS, etc)

* Copious (time series, huge population surveys, etc)


## To effective analyst of biological data you must have...

* Biological knowledge and intuition -- What does the data mean? What are the key questions? What are interesting patterns or findings in the data?

* Computational skills -- sort, filter, transform, and transform data and work with in an efficient and reproducible manner

* Statistical skills -- build and interpret quantitative statements (models) about patterns in your data, distinguish interesting "signal" from "noise" of natural biological variability and experimental design

## The goal of this course is to...


* Teach you foundational statistical and computational skills to effectively explore and analyze complex biological data when used in combination with your biological knowlege and intuition

## Specific learning objectives

* Learn to visualize and explore complex biological data

* Generate publication quality figures and tables

* Understand and apply various descriptive statistics for describing trends in data

* Understand and apply statistical tests and models such as t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression, chi-squared tests

* Carry out data exploration and analyses in a reproducible and documentable way
